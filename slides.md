# Getting started with open source

## What is open source?

> Open source describes software where the source code is available for anyone to view, use, change, and then share. Making source code publicly available allows others to build on and learn from it, enabling broad collaboration from people around the world.

> Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.
